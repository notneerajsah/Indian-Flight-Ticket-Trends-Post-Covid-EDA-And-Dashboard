# Indian Flight Ticket Trends: Post-Covid EDA & Dashboard 

## Overview ðŸŽ¯

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Indian domestic flight ticket prices post-Covid-19. With global events and rising ATF prices, ticket costs have fluctuated significantly.

The goal is to analyze **factors affecting ticket prices**, such as airline, class, flight duration, stops, and booking timing, and to answer questions like:

* How many flights are available across India?
* How do prices vary across airlines and classes?
* What is the optimal time to book tickets?
